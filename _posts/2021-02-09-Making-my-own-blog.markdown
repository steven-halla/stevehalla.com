Why do you want to build jekly?Because it means not having to set up a database.It also means you dont have to do tedious css work. it all works under the box and
its a huge step up from those pay to play blog sites you see all over the place.
So not only is jekly better, its free as well. 

I will explain how to make your very own blog using jekll. (pronounecd gee kul) I will go through everything step by step. If you own a windows pc your first step will be to buy a mac book.

To explain jekll.

When you want to write content you will do it in something called "markdown"files . These "markdown"files can be seen in your project folder on the side bar.
You can also attach HTML and CSS files as well. If your CSS file shows up as red, dont worry about it. Your blog will love having your css file highligthed in red.

title: Resume
permalink: /resume/

To get your files to work, make sure ,at top of your page you have something that looks like this, its an example page, you cant see the image now,but you will be able to in the future.
The perma link will turn your title into  an anchor tag which is how you will redirect around your blog site.
