I created a movie review app that started out in JavaScript but was then later converted into TypeScript.
This is a full CRUD app where users can create, read, update, and delete movie reviews as well as manage their own profiles.
Users will be able to create accounts and leave movie reviews. Users can also check out other user movie reviews.
There is a delete function that allows a user to delete their own reviews.
This project uses Material-UI for styling. A Restful API architecture is used for this project. MySQL is the DB that will be used. 
An Express framework with NodeJS libraries will be used for this project.

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/steven-halla/movie_review_site).
