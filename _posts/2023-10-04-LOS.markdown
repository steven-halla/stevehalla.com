LOS

I created a PYGAME program that handles LOS. Here are the following things that are covered:

Barriers-certain rectangles can be used to block LOS
Player Rect- allows the players to move in 8 directions
Enemey Rect - can change the color of player rect

The point of this program is for a game of sight tag. So when the player is sighted it changes color
and loses the match.
