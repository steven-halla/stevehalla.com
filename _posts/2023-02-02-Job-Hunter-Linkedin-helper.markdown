other data. You can leverage this to your advantage to reach out to people at the company.

then no worries, Job Hunter has you covered. There is a built in calendar, so you can more
easily track the time of your interviews, whom is interviewing you, interview prep work,
as well as the interview link all in one convenient location.

The jobs you've applied for can be easily tracked. There are two modes, all jobs mode and 
relevant mode (jobs you've applied to in the past 2 weeks , and also companies that have
responded interest). Data is displayed in an easy to read manner in a card system. Filtering 
is handled either by job date asc/dsc, or company name a-z/z-a, you can also 
filter out by typing out a contact/company name. 

Creating a new job is fast and easy, and takes less than a minute. There are tools to make
filling out applications faster, such as copy/paste icons for Linkedin, Github, and your 
portfolio web site.

The app also tracks how often you are hunting for jobs, this way you can keep yourself accountable
to be applying for the number of jos per week that you need to.
