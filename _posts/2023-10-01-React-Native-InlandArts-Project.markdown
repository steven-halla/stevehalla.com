This is a React-Native project that I built in Type-script. The app uses the Mapbox API to track the 
location of artworks that exist in specific galleries. The InlandArts App was built using Functional React. State was handled via useContext and useState.
The app was also capable of playing videos using react-native-video which were stored on our backend.

I was the sole Developer for the front-end. The following  are some screen shots of the app.
