Hobby Max is an E-Commerce store that sells things related to hobbies that I enjoy. This is my way of sharing a bit about myself to others.
The store uses a React Front end with API calls being made to a 3rd party website (Stripe).  The store features a shopping cart that allows you 
to buy modify your cart in various ways. When you go to check out and confirm your purchase you will receive a confirmation page. 

The storefront is hosted on AWS using an S3 bucket and Route 53.
