One of the reasons that you would want to build your blog site in Jekyll is because you don't need to have a DB. It also means you dont have to do tedious css work. It all works under the box and
it's a huge step up from those pay to play blog sites you see all over the place.
So not only is Jekyll better, it's also free to boot!

I will explain how to make your very own blog using Jekyll(pronounecd gee kul). I will go through everything step by step. If you own a windows pc your first step will be to buy a mac book.

When you want to write content you will do it in something called "markdown"files . These "markdown"files can be seen in your project folder on the side bar.
You can also attach HTML and CSS files as well. If your CSS file shows up as red, don't worry about it. Your blog will love having your css file highlighted in red.
